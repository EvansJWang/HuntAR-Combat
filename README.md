# HuntAR-Combat
 
 These are the C# Scripts written for a Augement Reality Game developed with Unity and React Native. 
 The Game mechanics are provided by Unity in their Survival Shooter tutorial. 
 
 The main additions are the ability to update player health and various stats based on Firebase data.
 
 The players' starting health, fire-rate, damage, etc are based on items equipped in the React-Native portion of the game
found here: https://github.com/EvansJWang/HuntAR

The Character managment screen written in React native will update the database and the Unity game will pull that data to update the 
player's stats in the game.
